This Google Sheets extension process the data contained into the sheet to generate one or more document by merging the data, and filtering the documents based on these data, into the templates (parametrized into the sheet). The generated documents are then stored into folders, converted (in PDF), shared and sent on your behalf.

It provides the following features:

* Easy to Install: Install the add-on directly on Google Sheets.
* Driven by Sheets: The data in the sheet drives the documents' generation.
* Based on Sheets: You can input data directly into Google Sheets, but you can also use formulas to compute new values. For example, you can convert lower case labels to upper case, capitalize them and merge THIS data and not the original one.
* Multiple Generation: Create multiple documents from one sheet.
* Your Own Markers: The fields in your Google Sheet ARE your markers.
* Conditional Sections: In your template, insert conditional sections based on variable names and values stored in your google sheet. The final documents only contain the sections satisfying the conditions.
* Multiple Versions: Create multiple versions of a document from one sheet thanks to the use of conditional sections.
* Multiple Input Formats: Use CSV, Excel, OpenOffice, LibreOffice as alternate spreadsheets.

In a few words, with Driven by sheets, Input One, Generate Many.
