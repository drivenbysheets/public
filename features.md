This Google Sheets extension process the data contained into the sheet to generate one or more document by merging the data, and filtering the documents based on these data, into the templates (parametrized into the sheet). The generated documents are then stored into folders, converted (in PDF), shared and sent on your behalf.

It provides the following features:

* Easy to Install: Install the add-on directly on Google Sheets.
* Driven by Sheets: The data in the sheet drives the documents' generation.
* Based on Sheets: You can input data directly into Google Sheets, but you can also use formulas to compute new values. For example, you can convert lower case labels to upper case, capitalize them and merge THIS data and not the original one.
* Multiple Generation: Create multiple documents from one sheet.
* Markers: Create your own markers based on the fields you created into your sheet.
* Conditional Sections: From one document, create as many versions you want based on values in your google sheet.
* Multiple Version: Create multiple versions of a document from one sheet thanks to the use of conditional sections.
* Multi-format: Use CSV, Excel, OpenOffice, LibreOffice as alternate spreadsheets.
